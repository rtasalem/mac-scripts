| Script | Description | Command|
| - | - | - |
| [help](./help.sh) | Lists all available commands. | `./help.sh` |
| [startup](./startup.sh) | Installs XCode (Command Line Tools) & Homebrew. | `./startup.sh` |
| [install](./install.sh) | Installs all of my most used applications via Homebrew. | `./install.sh` |
| [update](./update.sh) | Checks to see if there are any updates for Homebrew. Includes upgrades for packages installed via Homebrew. | `./update.sh` |
